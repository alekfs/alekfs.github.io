        GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>
        Berlin is the capital and largest city of Germany by both area and population. 
        Its 3.7 million inhabitants make it the European Union's most populous city, according to population within city limits.
        One of Germany's sixteen constituent states, Berlin is surrounded by the State of Brandenburg and contiguous with Potsdam, Brandenburg's capital. 
        Berlin's urban area, which has a population of around 4.5 million, is the second most populous urban area in Germany after the Ruhr. The Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has around 6.2 million inhabitants and is Germany's third-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr and Rhine-Main regions.
        Berlin straddles the banks of the Spree, which flows into the Havel (a tributary of the Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau. Among the city's main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree, Havel and Dahme, the largest of which is Lake Müggelsee. 
        Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals, and lakes. The city lies in the Central German dialect area, 
        the Berlin dialect being a variant of the Lusatian-New Marchian dialects.

                The Berliner Fernsehturm or Fernsehturm Berlin is a television tower in central Berlin, Germany.
                The tower was constructed between 1965 and 1969 by the government of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).
                It was intended to be both a symbol of Communist power and of the city.

                The Brandenburg Gate or Brandenburger Tor is an 18th-century neoclassical monument in Berlin, built on the orders of Prussian king Frederick William II after restoring the Orangist power by suppressing the Dutch popular unrest.
                One of the best-known landmarks of Germany, it was built on the site of a former city gate that marked the start of the road from Berlin to the town of Brandenburg an der Havel, which used to be the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg.

                The Reichstag officially: Deutscher Bundestag Reichstagsgebäude (Parliament) is a historic government building in Berlin which houses the Bundestag, the lower house of Germany's parliament.
                It was constructed to house the Imperial Diet (Reichstag) of the German Empire. It was opened in 1894 and housed the Diet until 1933, when it was set on fire. 
                In World War II, during the Battle of Berlin, the building was severely damaged by the Soviet Red Army.

                The Berlin Cathedral, also known as the Evangelical Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church, is a monumental German Evangelical church and dynastic tomb (House of Hohenzollern) on the Museum Island in central Berlin.
                Having its origins as a castle chapel for the Berlin Palace, several structures have served to house the church since the 15th century.

                The Victory Column (Siegessäule from Sieg victory + Säule column) is a monument in Berlin, Germany. 
                Designed by Heinrich Strack after 1864 to commemorate the Prussian victory in the Second Schleswig War, by the time it was inaugurated on 2 September 1873, Prussia had also defeated Austria and its German allies in the Austro-Prussian War (1866) and France in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), giving the statue a new purpose. 
                Berliners have given the statue the nickname Goldelse, meaning something like "Golden Lizzy".

        In the early 20th century, Berlin had become a fertile ground for the German Expressionist movement. In fields such as architecture, painting and cinema new forms of artistic styles were invented. 
        At the end of the First World War in 1918, a republic was proclaimed by Philipp Scheidemann at the Reichstag building. 
        In 1920, the Greater Berlin Act incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. 
        The act increased the area of Berlin from 66 to 883 km2 (25 to 341 sq mi). The population almost doubled, and Berlin had a population of around four million.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1933, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power. The National Socialist regime embarked on monumental construction projects in Berlin as a way to express their power and authority through architecture. 
        Hitler envisioned Berlin's renewal projects were to turn the city into the new capital of the Greater Germanic Reich. 
        NSDAP rule diminished Berlin's Jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all Jews in the country) to about 80,000 due to emigration between 1933 and 1939. 
        After Kristallnacht in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Starting in early 1943, many were shipped to concentration camps, such as Auschwitz.
        During World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed during 1943–45 Allied air raids and the 1945 Battle of Berlin. 
        The Allies dropped 67,607 tons of bombs on the city, destroying 6,427 acres of the built-up area. Around 125,000 civilians were killed. 
        After the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. 
        The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the occupation zones into which Germany was divided. 
        The sectors of the Western Allies (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) formed West Berlin, while the Soviet sector formed East Berlin.
    </p>
    <p>
        All four Allies shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. 
        However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the Soviet Union imposed a blockade on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. \
        The Berlin airlift, conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949.
        In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in West Germany and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the Marxist-Leninist German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in East Germany. 
        West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. 
        Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.

    <h2 id="Geography">GEOGRAPHY</h2>
    <p>
        Berlin is in northeastern Germany, in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat topography, part of the vast Northern European Plain which stretches all the way from northern France to western Russia. 
        The Berliner Urstromtal (an ice age glacial valley), between the low Barnim Plateau to the north and the Teltow plateau to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last Weichselian glaciation. 
        The Spree follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river Havel, which flows from north to south through western Berlin. 
        The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the Großer Wannsee. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the Großer Müggelsee in eastern Berlin.
