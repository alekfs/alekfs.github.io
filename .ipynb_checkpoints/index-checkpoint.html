        Born here in Boulder, CO and the typical Colorado native. Avid cyclist including mountain biking, gravel and cyclocross.
        Though I have never used Word for layout design again, I have continued honing and expanding my design skills to include digital, print, and motion design. 
        I also found a love for science and space in particular after I took an astronomy class on a whim. Nowadays, I use my creative skills to communicate my passion for learning and science and to 
        share my wonder for the world with everyone. 
        I currently live in Boulder, CO with my cat Sourdough, and as many houseplants as I can manage to keep alive â€“ usually between 0 and 3.</p>
